# Blue-Fire-Dye-Mod-Template
Template for changing the colour of Umbra's base tunic

How to use this Template:

Download the zip file and open the unreal engine project in Unreal Engine 4.25.4(Obviously extract the zip first)

Edit the colour values in the parameters of Player_Clothes_Basic to change the colours of the tunic

Remember to disable use pak file in project settings!

File>Save All

File>Package Project>Windows(64-bit)

Select the folder you want to package to 

Wait for it to package...




Follow standard modding procedure to produce a pak file and remember to delete all uassets and uexps except the Player_Clothes_Basic uasset and uexp before packaging

The mod should work perfectly now!(remember to add _P at the end of the pak file)

*please don't look at the original parent material it's a fucking mess*
